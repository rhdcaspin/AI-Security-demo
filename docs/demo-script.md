## Opening - Setting the Stage (3 minutes)

### Slide 1: Title Slide
**"Aligning Enterprise AI Security with MITRE ATLAS Using Open Source Technologies"**

> "Good morning, everyone! Today I'm excited to show you how we can protect our AI systems from adversarial attacks using the MITRE ATLAS framework and open source technologies."

### Slide 2: The AI Security Challenge
> "As AI becomes critical to business operations, we face new types of security threats. Traditional security tools weren't designed for adversarial examples, model extraction, or data poisoning attacks."

**Show statistics:**
- 30% of cyberattacks by 2025 will target AI systems (Gartner)
- Model theft incidents increased 300% in 2024
- Average cost of AI security breach: $4.5M

### Slide 3: What We'll Demonstrate Today
> "Today's demo will show three real attack scenarios mapped to MITRE ATLAS techniques, and how open source tools can detect and mitigate these threats in Kubernetes environments."

**Attack scenarios preview:**
1. 🎯 **Adversarial Examples** (T1551) - Fooling image classifiers
2. 🔓 **Model Extraction** (T1552) - Stealing model parameters  
3. ☠️ **Data Poisoning** (T1565) - Corrupting training data

## Demo Introduction (2 minutes)

### Show Architecture Diagram
> "Let me show you our demo environment. We have a vulnerable AI image classification service running in Kubernetes, protected by multiple open source security tools."

**Terminal 1: Show demo status**
```bash
./scripts/setup-demo.sh status
```

> "Our stack includes:
> - **Vulnerable AI Application**: Flask-based image classifier with intentional security flaws
> - **KubeArmor**: Runtime security enforcement using eBPF
> - **Falco**: Runtime threat detection with custom AI security rules
> - **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
> - **MITRE ATLAS**: Framework for understanding AI threats"

**Browser: Open Grafana Dashboard**
> "Here's our real-time security dashboard, showing AI-specific metrics and ATLAS technique mappings."

---

## Attack Scenario 1: Adversarial Examples (4 minutes)

### Setup Context
> "Our first attack demonstrates MITRE ATLAS technique T1551 - Evade ML Model. An attacker wants to fool our image classifier by creating adversarial examples."

**Terminal 2: Start Falco monitoring**
```bash
kubectl logs -f daemonset/falco -n security | grep -E "(WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL)"
```

**Terminal 3: Start KubeArmor monitoring**  
```bash
kubectl logs -f daemonset/kubearmor -n security | grep -E "(WARN|ERROR|ALERT)"
```

### Execute Attack
> "Let's launch the adversarial attack. The attacker starts by probing our model for information..."

**Terminal 1: Run adversarial attack**
```bash
./scripts/run-attack.sh adversarial
```

**Narrate during execution:**
> "Watch as our attacker:
> 1. **Reconnaissance**: Queries model endpoints for architecture details
> 2. **Adversarial Generation**: Creates perturbations to fool the classifier  
> 3. **DoS Simulation**: Floods the API with high-frequency requests"

### Show Detections
> "Look at our security tools in action!"

**Point to Terminal 2 (Falco):**
> "Falco immediately detected the model information disclosure and high-frequency query patterns."

**Point to Terminal 3 (KubeArmor):**
> "KubeArmor caught the suspicious process execution and file access attempts."

**Browser: Grafana Dashboard**
> "Our dashboard shows the spike in security events, automatically mapped to MITRE ATLAS T1551."

---

## Attack Scenario 2: Model Extraction (4 minutes)

### Setup Context
> "Next, we'll demonstrate T1552 - Steal ML Model. This is one of the most dangerous attacks because it can lead to intellectual property theft."

### Execute Attack
> "The attacker now attempts to extract our model's architecture and parameters..."

**Terminal 1: Run extraction attack**
```bash
./scripts/run-attack.sh extraction
```

**Narrate during execution:**
> "This attack has multiple phases:
> 1. **Information Gathering**: Extracting model metadata
> 2. **Weight Extraction**: Downloading layer parameters
> 3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Systematic querying to understand decision boundaries
> 4. **Model Reconstruction**: Building a substitute model"

### Show Real-time Detection
**Point to monitoring terminals:**
> "Notice how our security stack responds:
> - Falco detects the information disclosure attempts
> - KubeArmor blocks unauthorized file access to model files
> - Prometheus tracks the abnormal API usage patterns"

**Browser: Grafana Dashboard**
> "The dashboard now shows alerts for T1552 with detailed technique breakdown."

---

## Attack Scenario 3: Data Poisoning (3 minutes)

### Setup Context
> "Our final attack demonstrates T1565 - Data Manipulation, where an attacker tries to poison our training data."

### Execute Attack
**Terminal 1: Run poisoning attack**
```bash
./scripts/run-attack.sh poisoning
```

**Narrate during execution:**
> "The attacker is now:
> 1. **Uploading malicious feedback**: Corrupting our retraining data
> 2. **File upload attacks**: Attempting path traversal and malicious uploads
> 3. **Model replacement**: Trying to load a backdoored model"

### Show Comprehensive Detection
> "Our layered defense approach shows its strength here:"

**Terminal 2 & 3:**
> "Both Falco and KubeArmor detect different aspects of this multi-vector attack."

**Browser: Grafana Dashboard**
> "The dashboard provides a unified view of all three attack scenarios, mapped to their respective ATLAS techniques."
